The files in this directory are used to calculate the 256 blade products from PGA (G301). 
The file pre.txt shows the result of the calculations. This is also known as a Cayley table. 
The results from pre.txt are used to make a nested Python dictionary named product_table in the 
file constants.py, which is located outside this folder. 

The first two columns in pre.txt are the two blades, and the last column is their product.
